# BlakeChat
Blake chat is a messaging app allowing only authenticated users to message each other in a single chat room utilizing a Firebase cocoapod allowing us to create and interact with the database, as well as registering and authenticating users.

Next steps with this app:

* Encrypt messaging
* Tighten registration requirements
* Add apis to play with
* This project is a communal chat room for all users, similar to a slack or discord channel, rather than a P2P messaging app.
    * Figure out how to make it P2P or allow P2P functionality
* Cannot type a new message once message is sent, fix this
